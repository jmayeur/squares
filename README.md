squares
=======

A simple game built using AngularJS


background
=======

This is a very simple game, in which a user tries to pick the square that
is the most common color


why
=======

I wanted to experiment with some of the AngularJS approaches to services.  I
tried to do things like bind directly to a service response.


problems
========

It's clear where I failed to do test first -- the gameService.  I refactored to
add testing, but it's not a well thought out class


what worked
========

squareService - simple things are nice


what sucked
========

Well - it's a work in progress, I going to keep tinkering.
